  <title>The X Window System</title>

  <sect1 xml:id="x11-synopsis">
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>An installation of &os; using
      <application>bsdinstall</application> does not automatically
      install a graphical user interface.  This chapter describes how
      to install and configure <application>&xorg;</application>,
      which provides the open source X Window System used to provide a
      graphical environment.  It then describes how to find and
      install a desktop environment or window manager.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Users who prefer an installation method that automatically
	configures the <application>&xorg;</application> and offers a
	choice of window managers during installation should refer to
	the <link xlink:href="http://www.trueos.org/" />
	website.</para>
    </note>

    <title>Terminology</title>

    <para>While it is not necessary to understand all of the details
      of the various components in the X Window System and how they
      interact, some basic knowledge of these components can be
      useful.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>X server</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>X was designed from the beginning to be
	    network-centric, and adopts a <quote>client-server</quote>
	    model.  In this model, the <quote>X server</quote> runs on
	    the computer that has the keyboard, monitor, and mouse
	    attached.  The server's responsibility includes tasks such
	    as managing the display, handling input from the keyboard
	    and mouse, and handling input or output from other devices
	    such as a tablet or a video projector.  This confuses some
	    people, because the X terminology is exactly backward to
	    what they expect.  They expect the <quote>X server</quote>
	    to be the big powerful machine down the hall, and the
	    <quote>X client</quote> to be the machine on their
	    desk.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>X client</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Each X application, such as
	    <application>XTerm</application> or
	    <application>Firefox</application>, is a
	    <quote>client</quote>.  A client sends messages to the
	    server such as <quote>Please draw a window at these
	      coordinates</quote>, and the server sends back messages
	    such as <quote>The user just clicked on the OK
	      button</quote>.</para>

	  <para>In a home or small office environment, the X server
	    and the X clients commonly run on the same computer.  It
	    is also possible to run the X server on a less powerful
	    computer and to run the X applications on a more powerful
	    system.  In this scenario, the communication between the X
	    client and server takes place over the network.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>window manager</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>X does not dictate what windows should look like
	    on-screen, how to move them around with the mouse, which
	    keystrokes should be used to move between windows, what
	    the title bars on each window should look like, whether or
	    not they have close buttons on them, and so on.  Instead,
	    X delegates this responsibility to a separate window
	    manager application.  There are <link
	      xlink:href="http://www.xwinman.org/">dozens of window
	      managers</link> available.  Each window manager provides
	    a different look and feel: some support virtual desktops,
	    some allow customized keystrokes to manage the desktop,
	    some have a <quote>Start</quote> button, and some are
	    themeable, allowing a complete change of the desktop's
	    look-and-feel.  Window managers are available in the
	    <filename>x11-wm</filename> category of the Ports
	    Collection.</para>

	  <para>Each window manager uses a different configuration
	    mechanism.  Some expect configuration file written by hand
	    while others provide graphical tools for most
	    configuration tasks.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>desktop environment</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para><application>KDE</application> and
	    <application>GNOME</application> are considered to be
	    desktop environments as they include an entire suite of
	    applications for performing common desktop tasks.  These
	    may include office suites, web browsers, and games.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>focus policy</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The window manager is responsible for the mouse focus
	    policy.  This policy provides some means for choosing
	    which window is actively receiving keystrokes and it
	    should also visibly indicate which window is currently
	    active.</para>

	  <para>One focus policy is called
	    <quote>click-to-focus</quote>.  In this model, a window
	    becomes active upon receiving a mouse click.  In the
	    <quote>focus-follows-mouse</quote> policy, the window that
	    is under the mouse pointer has focus and the focus is
	    changed by pointing at another window.  If the mouse is
	    over the root window, then this window is focused.  In the
	    <quote>sloppy-focus</quote> model, if the mouse is moved
	    over the root window, the most recently used window still
	    has the focus.  With sloppy-focus, focus is only changed
	    when the cursor enters a new window, and not when exiting
	    the current window.  In the <quote>click-to-focus</quote>
	    policy, the active window is selected by mouse click.  The
	    window may then be raised and appear in front of all other
	    windows.  All keystrokes will now be directed to this
	    window, even if the cursor is moved to another
	    window.</para>

	  <para>Different window managers support different focus
	    models.  All of them support click-to-focus, and the
	    majority of them also support other policies.  Consult the
	    documentation for the window manager to determine which
	    focus models are available.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>widgets</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Widget is a term for all of the items in the user
	    interface that can be clicked or manipulated in some way.
	    This includes buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, icons,
	    and lists.  A widget toolkit is a set of widgets used to
	    create graphical applications.  There are several popular
	    widget toolkits, including Qt, used by
	    <application>KDE</application>, and GTK+, used by
	    <application>GNOME</application>.  As a result,
	    applications will have a different look and feel,
	    depending upon which widget toolkit was used to create the
	    application.</para>

    <title>Using Fonts in <application>&xorg;</application></title>

    <sect2 xml:id="type1">
      <title>Type1 Fonts</title>

      <para>The default fonts that ship with
	<application>&xorg;</application> are less than ideal for
	typical desktop publishing applications.  Large presentation
	fonts show up jagged and unprofessional looking, and small
	fonts are almost completely unintelligible.  However, there
	are several free, high quality Type1 (&postscript;) fonts
	available which can be readily used with
	<application>&xorg;</application>.  For instance, the URW font
	collection (<package>x11-fonts/urwfonts</package>) includes
	high quality versions of standard type1 fonts (<trademark
	  class="registered">Times Roman</trademark>, <trademark
	  class="registered">Helvetica</trademark>, <trademark
	  class="registered">Palatino</trademark> and others).  The
	Freefonts collection (<package>x11-fonts/freefonts</package>)
	includes many more fonts, but most of them are intended for
	use in graphics software such as the
	<application>Gimp</application>, and are not complete enough
	to serve as screen fonts.  In addition,
	<application>&xorg;</application> can be configured to use
	&truetype; fonts with a minimum of effort.  For more details
	on this, see the &man.X.7; manual page or <xref
	  linkend="truetype"/>.</para>

      <para>To install the above Type1 font collections from binary packages,
	run the following commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install urwfonts</userinput></screen>

      <para>Alternatively, to build from the Ports Collection, run the following
	commands:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11-fonts/urwfonts</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para>And likewise with the freefont or other collections.  To
	have the X server detect these fonts, add an appropriate line
	to the X server configuration file
	(<filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>), which reads:</para>

      <programlisting>FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/urwfonts/"</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, at the command line in the X session
	run:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp+ /usr/local/share/fonts/urwfonts</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp rehash</userinput></screen>

      <para>This will work but will be lost when the X session is
	closed, unless it is added to the startup file
	(<filename>~/.xinitrc</filename> for a normal
	<command>startx</command> session, or
	<filename>~/.xsession</filename> when logging in through a
	graphical login manager like <application>XDM</application>).
	A third way is to use the new
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename> as
	demonstrated in <xref linkend="antialias"/>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="truetype">
      <title>&truetype; Fonts</title>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>TrueType Fonts</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm>
	<primary>fonts</primary>
	<secondary>TrueType</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para><application>&xorg;</application> has built in support for
	rendering &truetype; fonts.  There are two different modules
	that can enable this functionality.  The freetype module is
	used in this example because it is more consistent with the
	other font rendering back-ends.  To enable the freetype module
	just add the following line to the <literal>"Module"</literal>
	section of <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>.</para>

      <programlisting>Load  "freetype"</programlisting>

      <para>Now make a directory for the &truetype; fonts (for
	example, <filename>/usr/local/share/fonts/TrueType</filename>)
	and copy all of the &truetype; fonts into this directory.
	Keep in mind that &truetype; fonts cannot be directly taken
	from an &apple; &mac;; they must be in
	&unix;/&ms-dos;/&windows; format for use by
	<application>&xorg;</application>.  Once the files have been
	copied into this directory, use
	<application>mkfontdir</application> to create a
	<filename>fonts.dir</filename>, so that the X font renderer
	knows that these new files have been installed.
	<command>mkfontdir</command> can be installed as a
	package:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install mkfontdir</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then create an index of X font files in a
	directory:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/local/share/fonts/TrueType</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkfontdir</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now add the &truetype; directory to the font path.  This
	is just the same as described in <xref
	  linkend="type1"/>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp+ /usr/local/share/fonts/TrueType</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>xset fp rehash</userinput></screen>

      <para>or add a <literal>FontPath</literal> line to
	<filename>xorg.conf</filename>.</para>

      <para>Now <application>Gimp</application>,
	<application>Apache OpenOffice</application>, and all of the
	other X applications should now recognize the installed
	&truetype; fonts.  Extremely small fonts (as with text in a
	high resolution display on a web page) and extremely large
	fonts (within <application>&staroffice;</application>) will
	look much better now.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>fonts</primary>
	<secondary>anti-aliased</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>All fonts in <application>&xorg;</application> that are
	found in <filename>/usr/local/share/fonts/</filename> and
	<filename>~/.fonts/</filename> are automatically made
	available for anti-aliasing to Xft-aware applications.  Most
	recent applications are Xft-aware, including
	<application>KDE</application>,
	<application>GNOME</application>, and
	<application>Firefox</application>.</para>

      <para>To control which fonts are anti-aliased, or to
	configure anti-aliasing properties, create (or edit, if it
	already exists) the file
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename>.  Several
	advanced features of the Xft font system can be tuned using
	this file; this section describes only some simple
	possibilities.  For more details, please see
	&man.fonts-conf.5;.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>XML</primary></indexterm>

      <para>This file must be in XML format.  Pay careful attention to
	case, and make sure all tags are properly closed.  The file
	begins with the usual XML header followed by a DOCTYPE
	definition, and then the <literal>&lt;fontconfig&gt;</literal>
	tag:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
      &lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
      &lt;fontconfig&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>As previously stated, all fonts in
	<filename>/usr/local/share/fonts/</filename> as well as
	<filename>~/.fonts/</filename> are already made available to
	Xft-aware applications.  To add another directory
	outside of these two directory trees, add a line like
	this to
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/fonts/local.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;dir&gt;/path/to/my/fonts&lt;/dir&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>After adding new fonts, and especially new font
	directories, rebuild
	the font caches:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>fc-cache -f</userinput></screen>

      <para>Anti-aliasing makes borders slightly fuzzy, which makes
	very small text more readable and removes
	<quote>staircases</quote> from large text, but can cause
	eyestrain if applied to normal text.  To exclude font sizes
	smaller than 14 point from anti-aliasing, include these
	lines:</para>

      <programlisting>        &lt;match target="font"&gt;
	    &lt;test name="size" compare="less"&gt;
		&lt;double&gt;14&lt;/double&gt;
	    &lt;/test&gt;
	    &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
		&lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
	    &lt;/edit&gt;
	&lt;/match&gt;
	&lt;match target="font"&gt;
	    &lt;test name="pixelsize" compare="less" qual="any"&gt;
		&lt;double&gt;14&lt;/double&gt;
	    &lt;/test&gt;
	    &lt;edit mode="assign" name="antialias"&gt;
		&lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
	    &lt;/edit&gt;
	&lt;/match&gt;</programlisting>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>fonts</primary>
	<secondary>spacing</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Spacing for some monospaced fonts might also be
	inappropriate with anti-aliasing.  This seems to be an issue
	with <application>KDE</application>, in particular.  One
	possible fix is to force the spacing for such fonts
	to be 100. Add these lines:</para>

      <programlisting>	&lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
	   &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
	       &lt;string&gt;fixed&lt;/string&gt;
	   &lt;/test&gt;
	   &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
	       &lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
	   &lt;/edit&gt;
	&lt;/match&gt;
	&lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
	    &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;console&lt;/string&gt;
	    &lt;/test&gt;
	    &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
	    &lt;/edit&gt;
	&lt;/match&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>(this aliases the other common names for fixed fonts as
	<literal>"mono"</literal>), and then add:</para>

      <programlisting>         &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
	     &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
		 &lt;string&gt;mono&lt;/string&gt;
	     &lt;/test&gt;
	     &lt;edit name="spacing" mode="assign"&gt;

	     &lt;/edit&gt;
	 &lt;/match&gt;      </programlisting>

      <para>Certain fonts, such as Helvetica, may have a problem when
	anti-aliased.  Usually this manifests itself as a font that
	seems cut in half vertically.  At worst, it may cause
	applications to crash.  To avoid this, consider adding the
	following to <filename>local.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>         &lt;match target="pattern" name="family"&gt;
	     &lt;test qual="any" name="family"&gt;
		 &lt;string&gt;Helvetica&lt;/string&gt;
	     &lt;/test&gt;
	     &lt;edit name="family" mode="assign"&gt;
		 &lt;string&gt;sans-serif&lt;/string&gt;
	     &lt;/edit&gt;
	 &lt;/match&gt;        </programlisting>

      <para>After editing
	<filename>local.conf</filename>, make certain to end the file
	with the <literal>&lt;/fontconfig&gt;</literal> tag.  Not
	doing this will cause changes to be ignored.</para>

      <para>Users can add personalized settings by creating their own
	<filename>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</filename>.  This
	file uses the same <acronym>XML</acronym> format described
	above.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>LCD screen</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Fonts</primary>
	<secondary>LCD screen</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>One last point: with an LCD screen, sub-pixel sampling may
	be desired.  This basically treats the (horizontally
	separated) red, green and blue components separately to
	improve the horizontal resolution; the results can be
	dramatic.  To enable this, add the line somewhere in
	<filename>local.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>	 &lt;match target="font"&gt;
	     &lt;test qual="all" name="rgba"&gt;
		 &lt;const&gt;unknown&lt;/const&gt;
	     &lt;/test&gt;
	     &lt;edit name="rgba" mode="assign"&gt;
		 &lt;const&gt;rgb&lt;/const&gt;
	     &lt;/edit&gt;
	 &lt;/match&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
	<para>Depending on the sort of display,
	  <literal>rgb</literal> may need to be changed to
	  <literal>bgr</literal>, <literal>vrgb</literal> or
	  <literal>vbgr</literal>: experiment and see which works
	  best.</para>

    <para>This section describes how to install three popular desktop
      environments on a &os; system.  A desktop environment can range
      from a simple window manager to a complete suite of desktop
      applications.  Over a hundred desktop environments are available
      in the <filename>x11-wm</filename> category of the Ports
      Collection.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="x11-wm-gnome">
      <title>GNOME</title>

      <indexterm><primary>GNOME</primary></indexterm>
      <para><application>GNOME</application> is a user-friendly
	desktop environment.  It includes a panel for starting
	applications and displaying status, a desktop, a set of tools
	and applications, and a set of conventions that make it easy
	for applications to cooperate and be consistent with each
	other.  More information regarding
	<application>GNOME</application> on &os; can be found at <link
	  xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome">http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome</link>.
	That web site contains additional documentation about
	installing, configuring, and managing
	<application>GNOME</application> on &os;.</para>

      <para>This desktop environment can be installed from a
	package:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install gnome3</userinput></screen>

      <para>To instead build <application>GNOME</application> from
	ports, use the following command.
	<application>GNOME</application> is a large application and
	will take some time to compile, even on a fast
	computer.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome3</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

      <para><application>GNOME</application>
	requires <filename>/proc</filename> to be mounted.  Add this
	line to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to mount this file
	system automatically during system startup:</para>

      <programlisting>proc           /proc       procfs  rw  0   0</programlisting>

      <para><application>GNOME</application> uses
	<application>D-Bus</application> and
	<application>HAL</application> for a message bus and hardware
	abstraction.  These applications are automatically installed
	as dependencies of <application>GNOME</application>.  Enable
	them in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> so they will be
	started when the system boots:</para>

      <programlisting>dbus_enable="YES"
hald_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>After installation,
	configure <application>&xorg;</application> to start
	<application>GNOME</application>.  The easiest way to do this
	is to enable the GNOME Display Manager,
	<application>GDM</application>, which is installed as part of
	the <application>GNOME</application> package or port.  It can
	be enabled by adding this line to
	<filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>gdm_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>It is often desirable to also start all
	<application>GNOME</application> services.  To achieve this,
	add a second line to <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>gnome_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para><application>GDM</application> will start
	automatically when the system boots.</para>

      <para>A second method for starting
	<application>GNOME</application> is to type
	<command>startx</command> from the command-line after
	configuring <filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>.  If this file
	already exists, replace the line that starts the current
	window manager with one that starts
	<filename>/usr/local/bin/gnome-session</filename>.  If this
	file does not exist, create it with this command:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "exec /usr/local/bin/gnome-session" &gt; ~/.xinitrc</userinput></screen>

      <para>A third method is to use <application>XDM</application> as
	the display manager.  In this case, create an executable
	<filename>~/.xsession</filename>:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "#!/bin/sh" &gt; ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "exec /usr/local/bin/gnome-session" &gt;&gt; ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod +x ~/.xsession</userinput></screen>

      <title>KDE</title>

      <indexterm><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>

      <para><application>KDE</application> is another easy-to-use
	desktop environment.  This desktop provides a suite of
	applications with a consistent look and feel, a standardized
	menu and toolbars, keybindings, color-schemes,
	internationalization, and a centralized, dialog-driven desktop
	configuration.  More information on
	<application>KDE</application> can be found at <link

	For &os;-specific information, consult <link
	  xlink:href="http://freebsd.kde.org/">http://freebsd.kde.org</link>.</para>

      <para>To install the <application>KDE</application> package,
	type:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install x11/kde4</userinput></screen>

      <para>To instead build the <application>KDE</application> port,
	use the following command.  Installing the port will provide a
	menu for selecting which components to install.
	<application>KDE</application> is a large application and will
	take some time to compile, even on a fast computer.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/ports/x11/kde4</userinput>

      <programlisting>kdm4_enable="YES"</programlisting>

      <para>A second method for launching
	<application>KDE</application> is to type
	<command>startx</command> from the command line.  For this to
	work, the following line is needed in
	<filename>~/.xinitrc</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>exec /usr/local/bin/startkde</programlisting>

      <para>A third method for starting <application>KDE</application>
	is through <application>XDM</application>.  To do so, create
	an executable <filename>~/.xsession</filename> as
	follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "#!/bin/sh" &gt; ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>echo "exec /usr/local/bin/startkde" &gt;&gt; ~/.xsession</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod +x ~/.xsession</userinput></screen>

&prompt.user; <userinput>emerald --replace &amp;</userinput></screen>

      <para>Your screen will flicker for a few seconds, as your window

    <title>Troubleshooting</title>

    <para>If the mouse does not work, you will need to first configure
      it before proceeding.
      In recent <application>Xorg</application>
      versions, the <literal>InputDevice</literal> sections in
      <filename>xorg.conf</filename> are ignored in favor of the
      autodetected devices.  To restore the old behavior, add the
      following line to the <literal>ServerLayout</literal> or
      <literal>ServerFlags</literal> section of this file:</para>

      <programlisting>Option "AutoAddDevices" "false"</programlisting>

      <para>Input devices may then be configured as in previous
	versions, along with any other options needed (e.g., keyboard
	layout switching).</para>

      <note>
	<para>As previously explained the
	  <application>hald</application> daemon will, by default,
	  automatically detect your keyboard.  There are chances that
	  your keyboard layout or model will not be correct, desktop
	  environments like <application>GNOME</application>,
	  <application>KDE</application> or
	  <application>Xfce</application> provide tools to configure
	  the keyboard.  However, it is possible to set the keyboard
	  properties directly either with the help of the
	  &man.setxkbmap.1; utility or with a
	  <application>hald</application>'s configuration rule.</para>

	<para>For example if, one wants to use a PC 102 keys keyboard
	  coming with a french layout, we have to create a keyboard
	  configuration file for <application>hald</application>
	  called <filename>x11-input.fdi</filename> and saved in the
	  <filename>/usr/local/etc/hal/fdi/policy</filename>
	  directory.  This file should contain the following
	  lines:</para>

	<programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;deviceinfo version="0.2"&gt;
  &lt;device&gt;
    &lt;match key="info.capabilities" contains="input.keyboard"&gt;
	  &lt;merge key="input.x11_options.XkbModel" type="string"&gt;pc102&lt;/merge&gt;
	  &lt;merge key="input.x11_options.XkbLayout" type="string"&gt;fr&lt;/merge&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;
  &lt;/device&gt;
&lt;/deviceinfo&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>If this file already exists, just copy and add to your
	  file the lines regarding the keyboard configuration.</para>

	<para>You will have to reboot your machine to force
	  <application>hald</application> to read this file.</para>

	<para>It is possible to do the same configuration from an X
	  terminal or a script with this command line:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>setxkbmap -model pc102 -layout fr</userinput></screen>

	<para><filename>/usr/local/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst</filename>
	  lists the various keyboard, layouts and options
	  available.</para>
      </note>

      <indexterm><primary><application>&xorg;</application>
	  tuning</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The <filename>xorg.conf.new</filename> configuration file
	may now be tuned to taste.  Open the file in a text editor
	such as &man.emacs.1; or &man.ee.1;.  If the monitor is an
	older or unusual model that does not support autodetection of
	sync frequencies, those settings can be added to
	<filename>xorg.conf.new</filename> under the
	<literal>"Monitor"</literal> section:</para>

      <programlisting>Section "Monitor"
	Identifier   "Monitor0"
	VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
	ModelName    "Monitor Model"
	HorizSync    30-107
	VertRefresh  48-120
EndSection</programlisting>

      <para>Most monitors support sync frequency autodetection, making
	manual entry of these values unnecessary.  For the few
	monitors that do not support autodetection, avoid potential
	damage by only entering values provided by the
	manufacturer.</para>

      <para>X allows DPMS (Energy Star) features to be used with
	capable monitors.  The &man.xset.1; program controls the
	time-outs and can force standby, suspend, or off modes.  If
	you wish to enable DPMS features for your monitor, you must
	add the following line to the monitor section:</para>

      <programlisting>Option       "DPMS"</programlisting>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><filename>xorg.conf</filename></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>While the <filename>xorg.conf.new</filename> configuration
	file is still open in an editor, select the default resolution
	and color depth desired.  This is defined in the
	<literal>"Screen"</literal> section:</para>

      <programlisting>Section "Screen"
	Identifier "Screen0"
	Device     "Card0"
	Monitor    "Monitor0"
	DefaultDepth 24
	SubSection "Display"
		Viewport  0 0
		Depth     24
		Modes     "1024x768"
	EndSubSection
EndSection</programlisting>

      <para>The <literal>DefaultDepth</literal> keyword describes the
	color depth to run at by default.  This can be overridden with
	the <option>-depth</option> command line switch to
	&man.Xorg.1;.  The <literal>Modes</literal> keyword describes
	the resolution to run at for the given color depth.  Note that
	only VESA standard modes are supported as defined by the
	target system's graphics hardware.  In the example above, the
	default color depth is twenty-four bits per pixel.  At this
	color depth, the accepted resolution is 1024 by 768
	pixels.</para>

      <para>Finally, write the configuration file and test it using
	the test mode given above.</para>

      <note>
	<para>One of the tools available to assist you during
	  troubleshooting process are the
	  <application>&xorg;</application> log files, which contain
	  information on each device that the
	  <application>&xorg;</application> server attaches to.
	  <application>&xorg;</application> log file names are in the
	  format of <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename>.  The
	  exact name of the log can vary from
	  <filename>Xorg.0.log</filename> to
	  <filename>Xorg.8.log</filename> and so forth.</para>
      </note>

      <para>If all is well, the configuration file needs to be
	installed in a common location where &man.Xorg.1; can find it.
	This is typically <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename> or
	<filename>/usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf</userinput></screen>

      <para>The <application>&xorg;</application> configuration
	process is now complete.  <application>&xorg;</application>
	may be now started with the &man.startx.1; utility.  The
	<application>&xorg;</application> server may also be started
	with the use of &man.xdm.1;.</para>

	<para>This will allow configuration of the hardware as any

	  &man.agp.4; driver compiled in the kernel, trying to load
	  the module with &man.kldload.8; will not work.  This driver

	<title>Adding a Widescreen Flatpanel to the Mix</title>

	  <primary>widescreen flatpanel configuration</primary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>This section assumes a bit of advanced configuration
	  knowledge.  If attempts to use the standard configuration
	  tools above have not resulted in a working configuration,
	  there is information enough in the log files to be of use in
	  getting the setup working.  Use of a text editor will be
	  necessary.</para>

	<para>Current widescreen (WSXGA, WSXGA+, WUXGA, WXGA, WXGA+,
	  et.al.) formats support 16:10 and 10:9 formats or aspect
	  ratios that can be problematic.  Examples of some common
	  screen resolutions for 16:10 aspect ratios are:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>2560x1600</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>1920x1200</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>1680x1050</para>
	  </listitem>

	    <para>1440x900</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>1280x800</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>At some point, it will be as easy as adding one of these
	  resolutions as a possible <literal>Mode</literal> in the
	  <literal>Section "Screen"</literal> as such:</para>

	<programlisting>Section "Screen"
Identifier "Screen0"
Device     "Card0"
Monitor    "Monitor0"
DefaultDepth 24
SubSection "Display"
	Viewport  0 0
	Depth     24
	Modes     "1680x1050"
EndSubSection
EndSection</programlisting>

	<para><application>&xorg;</application> is smart enough to
	  pull the resolution information from the widescreen via
	  I2C/DDC information so it knows what the monitor can handle
	  as far as frequencies and resolutions.</para>

	<para>If those <literal>ModeLines</literal> do not exist in
	  the drivers, one might need to give
	  <application>&xorg;</application> a little hint.  Using
	  <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> one can extract
	  enough information to manually create a
	  <literal>ModeLine</literal> that will work.  Simply look for
	  information resembling this:</para>

	<programlisting>(II) MGA(0): Supported additional Video Mode:
(II) MGA(0): clock: 146.2 MHz   Image Size:  433 x 271 mm
(II) MGA(0): h_active: 1680  h_sync: 1784  h_sync_end 1960 h_blank_end 2240 h_border: 0
(II) MGA(0): v_active: 1050  v_sync: 1053  v_sync_end 1059 v_blanking: 1089 v_border: 0
(II) MGA(0): Ranges: V min: 48  V max: 85 Hz, H min: 30  H max: 94 kHz, PixClock max 170 MHz</programlisting>

	<para>This information is called EDID information.  Creating a
	  <literal>ModeLine</literal> from this is just a matter of
	  putting the numbers in the correct order:</para>

	<programlisting>ModeLine &lt;name&gt; &lt;clock&gt; &lt;4 horiz. timings&gt; &lt;4 vert. timings&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>So that the <literal>ModeLine</literal> in
	  <literal>Section "Monitor"</literal> for this example would
	  look like this:</para>

	<programlisting>Section "Monitor"
Identifier      "Monitor1"
VendorName      "Bigname"
ModelName       "BestModel"
ModeLine        "1680x1050" 146.2 1680 1784 1960 2240 1050 1053 1059 1089
Option          "DPMS"
EndSection</programlisting>

	<para>Now having completed these simple editing steps, X
	  should start on your new widescreen monitor.</para>
